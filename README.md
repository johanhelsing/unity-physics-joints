# Unity Physics Joints

This is almost a clean copy of the [code in the official unity physics samples](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/EntityComponentSystemSamples/tree/master/UnityPhysicsSamples/Assets/Demos/4.%20Joints/Scripts).
Wrapped so it can be installed as a UPM package.

I expect this or a similar API will be made available as public API at some point, this is just something to use in the
meantime.

## Changes to the original version

- Added component menus
- Added entity conversion requirement
